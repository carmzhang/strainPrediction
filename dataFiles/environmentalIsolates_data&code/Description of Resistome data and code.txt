Description of data and code

Folder1 resistome_original_data:
There are two subfolders inside. One is all data collected from plate reader in microscope room(X3), the other is for normal Tecan(J,K,loaner).
In each folder there is a loaddata.m file, which is used to read original excel file and generate mat file.

Note, for data recorded from X3, as the format saved is an old version, the matlab cannot directly read that. What I did before is to open the file in excel and save as a latest version, delete the old file, and use the new version file in matlab.

Note, the generated mat files could contain multiple extra blank data, which will be deleted later when matching with TAG (strain ID) in folder2, match_data_plot.m.

Folder2 resistome_mat_data&code:
This folder contains all growth curve mat files, with growth curve (after minus blank) in row with 6 replicates. Meanwhile, it includes m file used to match strain number with curves, and m file used to generate final training dataset.

(1) match_data_plot.m
This code is used to compile all mat data and match data with strain ID in match_data_plot.xlsx.
The code also save 4 final mat files: 

'Straindata_new_0308new.mat': data with 12 replicates 
'Straindata_single_0308.mat':data with only 6 replicates
'Straindata_multi_0308.mat':data with 24 repicates
'Straindata_trip_0308.mat': data with 18 replicates

(2)data_combine_0308.m
This is used to combine all mat file together and delete extra replicates.
The saved mat file "Straindata_latest_0308.mat".

(3)Straindata_latest_0308.mat
This file contains all growth curves with strain ID in the first col. Each strain has 12 replicates collected from 2 runs. The data was recorded in row.

(4)match_data_plot.xlsx
This is used as the TAG of each strain, the file would be read into match_data_plot.m.

(5)Resistome_machine_record.xlsx
This file includes all original information of each run and machine used.
